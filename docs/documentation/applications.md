### Internet Explorer: DLG_FLAGS_INVALID_CA "Your PC doesn’t trust this website’s security certificate."

*Because this site uses HTTP Strict Transport Security, you can’t continue to this site at this time.*

This error is due to issues regarding Zscaler's root CA certificate, this needs to be downloaded and installed again.

- [Zscaler root CA Certificate](http://keyserver.xxx.com/pki/X3/ZscalerRootCertificate-2048-SHA256.crt)

Download the certificate. Double click it and install for user, then do the same and install for machine, and lastly restart Internet Explorer.

### Internet Explorer: Not prompting to download .csv files

This issue can be resolved by creating some registry values to recognize the filetypes and the app to open these in.

```
REG ADD "HKEY_CLASSES_ROOT\MIME\Database\Content Type\application/csv" /v CLSID /t REG_SZ /d "{00020812-0000-0000-C000-000000000046}" /f
REG ADD "HKEY_CLASSES_ROOT\MIME\Database\Content Type\application/csv" /v Encoding /t REG_BINARY /d 08000000 /f
REG ADD "HKEY_CLASSES_ROOT\MIME\Database\Content Type\application/csv" /v Extension /t REG_SZ /d ".csv" /f

REG ADD "HKEY_CLASSES_ROOT\MIME\Database\Content Type\text/csv" /v CLSID /t REG_SZ /d "{00020812-0000-0000-C000-000000000046}" /f
REG ADD "HKEY_CLASSES_ROOT\MIME\Database\Content Type\text/csv" /v Encoding /t REG_BINARY /d 08000000 /f
REG ADD "HKEY_CLASSES_ROOT\MIME\Database\Content Type\text/csv" /v Extension /t REG_SZ /d ".csv" /f

# {00020812-0000-0000-C000-000000000046} is the CLSID for Excel 2016
# {25336920-03F9-11cf-8FD0-00AA00686F13} is the CLSID for the "Browse in place", for filetypes you would want to force open in the browser.
```

### Internet Explorer: There was a temporary DNS error. Error Code:  INET_E_RESOURCE_NOT_FOUND

*This error may occur after installing Microsoft Windows Creators update*

### Microsoft EDGE: Plugins

- [Reference article](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/deployedge/faqs-edge-in-the-enterprise)

Does Microsoft Edge (Chromium-based) support ActiveX controls or BHOs like Silverlight or Java?

No. Microsoft Edge doesn't support ActiveX controls or Browser Help Objects (BHOs) like Silverlight or Java. However, if you're running web apps that use ActiveX controls, BHOs, or legacy document modes on Internet Explorer 11, you can configure them to run in IE mode on the new Microsoft Edge. For more information, see Configure IE mode on Microsoft Edge.


### Google Chrome: "The application has failed to start because its side-by-side configuration is incorrect."

This error is generally resolved by quickly re-installing google chrome, in our environment there are cases where removing/upgrading chrome fails because the old installation reference is still in the registry. So instead of installing as it should the package delivery system asks for the old installer to remove the old app. In the registry location below there should be a google chrome reference, if it is deleted then the software can be pushed.



```

HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Classes\Installer\Products\KeyID
```

### Google Chrome/Firefox: To export a list you must have a Microsoft SharePoint Foundation compatible application

This is an error message you will receive if you are trying to export sharepoint lists in firefox/chrome, this is due that both these browsers doesn't support ActiveX controls which is used in sharepoint 2013 to validate if you have excel installed, this controller is called SpreadSheetLauncher. For this feature use Internet Explorer.

### Google Chrome: corrupt user profile

```
Rename-Item "$env:LOCALAPPDATA\Google\Chrome\User Data\Default" "$env:LOCALAPPDATA\Google\Chrome\User Data\Default.old" -confirm:$false
Copy-Item "$env:LOCALAPPDATA\Google\Chrome\User Data\Default.old\bookmarks" "$env:LOCALAPPDATA\Google\Chrome\User Data\Default\" -confirm:$false
```

### Google Chrome: displays window in all white or black

Open run and paste in the command below, if it runs sucessfully update the graphics driver on the computer

```
"C:\Program Files (x86)\Google\Chrome\Application\chrome.exe" --disable-gpu
```

### Google Chrome: Not saving bookmarks, not properly closing app, etc

This specific machine was for some reason being pushed an AppV version of both Chrome and FireFox, both these versions of the browsers are normally intended for VDE/VDL's in the citrix environment. This is why the browser was glitchy and not working properly, citrix is more restricted. Quick fix here was to just remove the shortcuts to the AppV launchers. 

```
C:\Users\UserID\AppData\Local\Microsoft\AppV\Client\Integration\
```

## Java
### The following resource is signed with a weak signature algorithm MD5withRSA and is treated as unsigned.

As of java 8u131 applications signed with MD5withRSA/DSA algorithms are treated as unsigned. To bypass this modify the java.security file in the program files folder to still allow the algorithm.

```
((Get-Content -path "C:\Program Files (x86)\Java\jre1.8.*\lib\security\java.security") -replace 'jdk.jar.disabledAlgorithms=MD2, MD5, RSA keySize < 1024','#jdk.jar.disabledAlgorithms=MD2, MD5, RSA keySize < 1024') | Set-Content -Path "C:\Program Files (x86)\Java\jre1.8.*\lib\security\java.security"
